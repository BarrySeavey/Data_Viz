# Data_Viz
Misc visualization results from my PRED455 class from Northwestern.

GOT ones use data from:

Source: A. Beveridge and J. Shan, "Network of
Thrones," Math Horizons Magazine , Vol. 23, No. 4
(2016), pp. 18-22.

Software used for the network associations was Gephi (https://gephi.org/).  
Some final tweaking/editing done in Inkscape.
